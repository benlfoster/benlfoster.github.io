An exactly solvable family of models describing the wrinkling of substrate-supported inextensible
elastic rings under compression is identified. The resulting wrinkle profiles are shown to be related
to the buckled states of an unsupported ring and are therefore universal. Closed analytical expres-
sions for the resulting universal shapes are provided, including the one-to-one relations between
the pressure and tension at which these emerge. The analytical predictions agree with numerical
continuation results to within numerical accuracy, for a large range of parameter values, up to the
point of self-contact.
