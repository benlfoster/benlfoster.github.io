======
I am a graduate student in the physics department at UC Berkeley interested in the intersection of Nonlinear Dynamics, Elasticity, and Biophysics.

Research
======
My research centers on the nonlinear response of thin membranes on a springy substrate to applied pressure.  This basic system has broad relevance to a host of systems in biology and fluid dynamics.

Courses
======
I have been a Graduate Student Instructor at Berkeley for 6 semesters.  The courses I have taught are shown below:
