I am a graduate student in the physics department at UC Berkeley interested in the intersection of Nonlinear Dynamics, Elasticity, and Biophysics.

Research
======
<br/><img src='/images/wrinkles_low.png'>
My research centers on the nonlinear response of thin elastic membranes on a springy substrate to applied loads.  This basic system has broad relevance to a host of systems in biology and fluid dynamics such as arteries and airways and provides an exciting testbed for analyzing wrinkling and folding responses.
