I have been a Graduate Student Instructor at UC Berkeley for 8 semesters.  I have assisted as a teaching assistant with the following courses:

Physics 8B: Introductory Physics (x3)
======
Introduction to electricity, magnetism, electromagnetic waves, optics, and modern physics. The course presents concepts and methodologies for understanding physical phenomena, and is particularly useful preparation for upper division study in biology and architecture.

I have taught this class both in-person and fully remote.

Physics 7C: Physics for Scientists and Engineers
======
Electromagnetic waves, optics, relativity, and quantum physics.

Physics 105: Analytic Mechanics 
======
Newtonian mechanics, motion of a particle in one, two, and three dimensions, Lagrangeâ€™s equations, Hamilton's equations, central force motion, moving coordinate systems, mechanics of continuous media, oscillations, normal modes, rigid body dynamics, tensor analysis techniques. Some knowledge of Python required for homework assignments. 

Physics C21: Physics and Music
======
What can we learn about the nature of reality and the ways that we humans have invented to discover how the world works? An exploration of these questions through the physical principles encountered in the study of music. The applicable laws of mechanics, fundamentals of sound, harmonic content, principles of sound production in musical instruments, musical scales.
